### Penetration Test Findings: Issues, Impacts, and Remediation Steps

Based on the findings from your penetration test, here is a summary of the identified issues, their potential impacts, and recommended remediation steps, presented in British English.

---

#### 1. Environment Variable Injection Risk

* **Issue Description**: Environment variable placeholders within the SQL scripts (specifically in `202206221918-mq-config-carriers-dml.sql` on lines 7 and 11, and in `202208031010-predict-feed2.sql` on line 14) might be susceptible to injection attacks. [cite: 1, 2] If an attacker can control the values of these environment variables, they could potentially inject malicious SQL code.
* **Impact**: This vulnerability is currently assessed as **Low Risk**. [cite: 1] However, successful exploitation could lead to unauthorised data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially compromise the database server.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    * Employ prepared statements with variable binding instead of directly concatenating strings for SQL queries. [cite: 2]
    * Implement a secure mechanism for substituting environment variables. For instance, instead of using string templates like `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., s3_dirty, ...) VALUES (..., 'dsa-cdl-s3-borderforce-predict-dirty-${ENV}', ...);`, adopt a parameter binding approach such as `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., s3_dirty, ...) VALUES (..., ?, ...);` and ensure the parameter is bound securely. [cite: 2, 3]
    * Validate the values of environment variables against a predefined, strict pattern before they are utilised in any operations. [cite: 4]

#### 2. Lack of Statement Parameterisation

* **Issue Description**: SQL statements identified across all files with `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations utilise direct value insertion rather than parameterisation. [cite: 5] This practice can expose the application to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Impact**: This vulnerability is currently assessed as **Low Risk**. [cite: 5] If input values are not properly sanitised, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorised access, data manipulation, or denial of service.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    * Consistently use prepared statements with parameter binding for all SQL queries. For example, instead of `INSERT INTO public.cert_config (id, description, ...) VALUES (nextval('cert_config_id_seq'), 'Test config', ...);`, use a parameterised query like `INSERT INTO public.cert_config (id, description, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...);`, ensuring parameters are bound securely. [cite: 5, 6, 7]
    * If using tools like Liquibase, adhere to their recommended patterns for parameter substitution. [cite: 7]
    * Consider employing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, which typically handle statement parameterisation automatically. [cite: 7]

#### 3. Insufficient Data Validation

* **Issue Description**: Several tables, as defined in `202206221737-cert-config-ddl.sql` and `202308241405-response-audit-ddl.sql`, lack adequate constraints for data validation. [cite: 8] This can lead to inconsistent or corrupt data within the database.
* **Impact**: This vulnerability is currently assessed as **Low Risk**. [cite: 8] The absence of proper validation can result in data integrity issues, application errors, and potentially allow for the storage of malformed data that could be exploited in other ways.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    * Implement appropriate `CHECK` constraints to enforce data validation rules. [cite: 9]
    * Specify sensible length limits for `VARCHAR` columns to prevent overly long inputs. [cite: 9]
    * Add `NOT NULL` constraints to fields that are mandatory. [cite: 9]
    * For example, instead of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR, filer_carrier_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, ...);`, enhance it with constraints like `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(255), filer_carrier_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (filer_carrier_id ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9]+$'), ...);`. [cite: 8, 9]
    * Consider using domain types for data formats that require specialised validation. [cite: 10]

---

#### 4. Exposed Internal Infrastructure Details

* **Issue Description**: Sensitive internal infrastructure details, such as queue names and directory structures, are directly exposed within scripts including `202206221918-mq-config-carriers-dml.sql`, `202207011045-update-data-feed-filename-pattern.sql`, and `202305191505-data-feed-fix.sql`. [cite: 10, 11]
* **Impact**: This vulnerability is currently assessed as **Low Risk**. [cite: 10] Exposing these details can provide attackers with valuable information about the internal workings of the system, potentially aiding them in crafting more targeted attacks.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    * Store all infrastructure-specific details in external configuration files or services, rather than hard-coding them in scripts. [cite: 11]
    * Utilise reference keys or aliases instead of actual infrastructure paths or names within the scripts. [cite: 11]
    * Implement a configuration lookup pattern. For example, instead of `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., inbound_mq_queue, outbound_mq_queue, ...) VALUES (..., 'PREDICT.IN.CARA', 'PREDICT.OUT.CARA', ...);`, use a method like `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., inbound_mq_queue, outbound_mq_queue, ...) VALUES (..., get_config('QUEUE_CARA_IN'), get_config('QUEUE_CARA_OUT'), ...);`. [cite: 11, 12]
    * Consider encrypting any sensitive infrastructure details, especially if they must be stored in less secure locations. [cite: 13]

---

#### 5. Limited Column Constraints

* **Issue Description**: Many columns in the created tables, particularly `VARCHAR` columns in `202206221737-cert-config-ddl.sql` (lines 6-12) and `202308241405-response-audit-ddl.sql` (lines 9-18), lack specific length restrictions or other data type constraints. [cite: 13, 14]
* **Impact**: This vulnerability is currently assessed as **Low Risk**. [cite: 13] Without proper constraints, there is a risk of data truncation if oversized data is inserted, inefficient storage utilisation, and potential performance degradation. It can also lead to unexpected application behaviour if data does not conform to expected formats or sizes.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    * Define and apply appropriate length constraints to all `VARCHAR` columns based on the expected data. [cite: 15]
    * Implement other necessary data type constraints to ensure data integrity. [cite: 14] For example, instead of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR, filer_carrier_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, ...);`, specify lengths: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(255), filer_carrier_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, ...);`. [cite: 14, 15]
    * Consider using more specialised data types where appropriate (e.g., `UUID` for unique identifiers) to enforce format and uniqueness. [cite: 16]




Okay, here's a description, impact, and remediation steps for the identified vulnerabilities, suitable for a penetration test report using British English:

## Vulnerability: Weak SSL/TLS Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2183
**Severity:** Medium

### Description
The SSL/TLS service on port 443 was found to support the `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA` cipher suite. This cipher suite utilises the Triple DES (3DES) symmetric encryption algorithm, which employs a 64-bit block size. It is known to be vulnerable to a cryptographic attack called SWEET32. This attack is a type of birthday attack that allows a man-in-the-middle attacker, under certain conditions (such as a long-lived HTTPS connection), to recover small amounts of plaintext from encrypted traffic by capturing and analysing a large volume of data (approximately 785GB).

### Impact
If successfully exploited, an attacker capable of monitoring network traffic between a user and the vulnerable server could potentially decrypt sensitive information from the encrypted session. This could include session cookies, authentication credentials, or other confidential data transmitted over the HTTPS connection. While the attack requires a significant amount of data to be captured, long-lived sessions common in some web applications can increase the feasibility of such an attack. The use of this deprecated cipher suite weakens the overall security posture of the SSL/TLS communication.

### Remediation Steps
1.  **Disable 3DES Cipher Suites:** Reconfigure the SSL/TLS service to disable support for all cipher suites that use 3DES. Specifically, `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA` should be removed from the list of accepted ciphers.
2.  **Prioritise Strong Cipher Suites:** Ensure the server is configured to use strong, modern cipher suites. Recommended options typically include those using AES-GCM (e.g., `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` for TLSv1.3) or AES-CBC with robust key exchange mechanisms, provided they are not vulnerable to other attacks.
3.  **Regularly Review Cipher Configuration:** Periodically review and update the SSL/TLS cipher suite configuration to align with current industry best practices and to remove any ciphers that have been found to be weak or deprecated.
4.  **Server-Side Cipher Preference:** If not already configured, ensure the server dictates the choice of cipher suite (`cipher preference: server`) rather than the client. This helps enforce the use of the strongest mutually supported cipher.

## Vulnerability: Lack of Forward Secrecy in SSL/TLS Configuration

**Severity:** Medium

### Description
The SSL/TLS service on port 443 does not support cipher suites that provide Forward Secrecy (also known as Perfect Forward Secrecy or PFS). The Nmap scan reported: "Forward Secrecy not supported by any cipher". Forward Secrecy is a property of cryptographic key exchange mechanisms that ensures that if the server's long-term private key is compromised, past encrypted sessions cannot be decrypted. The currently configured RSA-based key exchange cipher suites (e.g., `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`) do not offer this protection.

### Impact
Without Forward Secrecy, if an attacker gains access to the server's private key (for example, through a server breach, social engineering, or cryptanalysis at some point in the future), they would be able to decrypt any previously captured SSL/TLS traffic that was encrypted using that key. This could expose all historical sensitive data transmitted to and from the server, even if the server is subsequently secured or the key is changed.

### Remediation Steps
1.  **Enable Cipher Suites Supporting Forward Secrecy:** Reconfigure the SSL/TLS service to enable and prioritise cipher suites that provide Forward Secrecy. These typically use Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanisms, such as:
    * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
    * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
    * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
    * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
    * Cipher suites available with TLSv1.3 (e.g., `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`) inherently provide Forward Secrecy.
2.  **Prioritise ECDHE over DHE:** Where possible, prefer Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) cipher suites over traditional Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) suites as ECDHE offers similar security with better performance.
3.  **Ensure TLSv1.2 or Higher:** While the scan shows TLSv1.2 is in use, ensure that older, insecure protocols like SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1 are disabled. TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 provide better support for strong cipher suites, including those with Forward Secrecy.
4.  **Server-Side Cipher Preference:** Ensure the server is configured to select the cipher suite from its own list of preferences (`cipher preference: server`), ensuring that a Forward Secrecy cipher suite is chosen if supported by the client.
