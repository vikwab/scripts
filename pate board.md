Limited Access to In-Scope Components: Throughout the engagement, full access to all components defined within the agreed-upon scope was not consistently available. This limitation restricted the ability to perform a comprehensive security assessment across the entire target environment as initially planned. Specific components or areas with restricted access are detailed in the findings section of this report where applicable.

Significant Mid-Engagement Delay: The assessment process experienced a considerable delay of over one week during the engagement period. This interruption was due to [Optional: Briefly and neutrally state the reason for the delay if appropriate and known, e.g., "awaiting environment remediation," "pending provision of updated credentials," or simply "unforeseen circumstances." If the reason is sensitive or unknown, it's acceptable to omit this specific detail.]. This delay impacted the originally scheduled timeline for the assessment activities and subsequently delayed the completion and delivery of this report.


A penetration test conducted on the PREDECT project highlighted several security concerns. Whilst many of the issues found are technical in nature, they primarily concern the risk of unauthorised access and potential data exposure. It’s important to address these vulnerabilities, as they could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive project data.

Several critical and high-risk findings were identified, which are crucial for the project’s security. Most notably, there are vulnerabilities related to deserialisation of untrusted data in Apache MINA and Apache Tomcat, which could lead to remote code execution. Additionally, a Golang crypto SSH vulnerability could allow authorisation bypass, and an AsyncHttpClient flaw might lead to cookie clobbering, potentially causing improper authentication or session hijacking. Addressing these issues requires upgrading the affected components and implementing stricter security configurations, such as whitelisting classes for deserialisation in Apache MINA and ensuring secure default servlet configurations in Tomcat.

In addition to these high-risk issues, several medium and low-risk findings were also observed. These include a medium-risk Curl improper permission preservation issue that could lead to information disclosure, and a Zlib heap-based buffer overflow that could result in denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Low-risk findings encompass environment variable injection risks, lack of SQL statement parameterisation, insufficient data validation, exposed internal infrastructure details, limited column constraints, the SWEET32 attack vulnerability in 3DES, and a Curl HSTS check bypass. Whilst these issues are not as immediately threatening, they could lead to more significant problems if left unaddressed. Strengthening policies around input validation, secure coding practices, and regular patching will help mitigate these risks.

Overall, the primary focus should be on addressing the critical and high-risk vulnerabilities by applying necessary patches and secure configurations. For medium and low-risk items, a systematic approach to improving coding practices, data validation, and infrastructure configuration will enhance the overall security posture. By addressing these vulnerabilities, the PREDECT project can significantly reduce its exposure to security threats and ensure a more robust, secure infrastructure moving forward.
