Limited Access to In-Scope Components: Throughout the engagement, full access to all components defined within the agreed-upon scope was not consistently available. This limitation restricted the ability to perform a comprehensive security assessment across the entire target environment as initially planned. Specific components or areas with restricted access are detailed in the findings section of this report where applicable.

Significant Mid-Engagement Delay: The assessment process experienced a considerable delay of over one week during the engagement period. This interruption was due to [Optional: Briefly and neutrally state the reason for the delay if appropriate and known, e.g., "awaiting environment remediation," "pending provision of updated credentials," or simply "unforeseen circumstances." If the reason is sensitive or unknown, it's acceptable to omit this specific detail.]. This delay impacted the originally scheduled timeline for the assessment activities and subsequently delayed the completion and delivery of this report.


A penetration test conducted on the PREDECT project highlighted several security concerns within its container images. Whilst many of the issues found are technical in nature, they primarily concern the risk of unauthorised access and potential data exposure due to vulnerable software components identified in these images. It’s important to address these vulnerabilities, as they could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive project data.

Several critical and high-risk findings were identified within the container images, which are crucial for the project’s security. Most notably, there are vulnerabilities related to deserialisation of untrusted data in Apache MINA and Apache Tomcat components, which could lead to remote code execution. Additionally, a Golang crypto SSH vulnerability could allow authorisation bypass, and an AsyncHttpClient flaw might lead to cookie clobbering, potentially causing improper authentication or session hijacking. Addressing these issues requires updating the base images or the affected components within the container images and implementing stricter security configurations, such as whitelisting classes for deserialisation in Apache MINA and ensuring secure default servlet configurations in Tomcat.

In addition to these high-risk issues, several medium and low-risk findings were also observed in the software components within the container images. These include a medium-risk Curl improper permission preservation issue that could lead to information disclosure, and a Zlib heap-based buffer overflow that could result in denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Low-risk findings encompass environment variable injection risks, lack of SQL statement parameterisation, insufficient data validation, exposed internal infrastructure details, limited column constraints, the SWEET32 attack vulnerability in 3DES, and a Curl HSTS check bypass. Whilst these issues are not as immediately threatening, they could lead to more significant problems if left unaddressed. Strengthening policies around input validation, secure coding practices, regular updating of container images, and patching of components will help mitigate these risks.

Overall, the primary focus should be on addressing the critical and high-risk vulnerabilities within the container images by applying necessary patches and secure configurations to the software components. For medium and low-risk items, a systematic approach to improving coding practices, data validation, infrastructure configuration, and maintaining updated and secure container images will enhance the overall security posture. By addressing these vulnerabilities, the PREDECT project can significantly reduce its exposure to security threats and ensure a more robust, secure infrastructure moving forward.




**Vulnerabilites**

Based on the penetration test findings you provided, here is a concise summary of the Description, Impact, and Remediation steps for each identified vulnerability:

### Penetration Test Findings

Here are the security vulnerabilities identified in the PREDECT Project:

---

**1. Environment Variable Injection Risk**

* **Description:** Environment variable placeholders might be vulnerable to injection. [cite: 1, 2] This was noted in files `202206221918-mq-config-carriers-dml.sql` (lines 7, 11) and `202208031010-predict-feed2.sql` (line 14) where "${ENV}" is used. [cite: 2]
* **Impact:** Low risk.
* **Remediation Steps:**
    * Employ prepared statements with variable binding instead of string concatenation. [cite: 2]
    * Implement a secure mechanism for environment variable substitution. For example, instead of using a string template like `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., s3_dirty, ...) VALUES (..., 'dsa-cdl-s3-borderforce-predict-dirty-${ENV}', ...);`, use a parameter binding approach such as `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., s3_dirty, ...) VALUES (..., ?, ...);` and bind the parameter securely. [cite: 2, 3]
    * Validate the values of environment variables against a defined pattern before they are utilised. [cite: 4]

---

**2. Lack of Statement Parameterisation**

* **Description:** SQL statements directly insert values rather than using parameterisation. [cite: 5] This affects all files that contain INSERT/UPDATE statements. [cite: 5]
* **Impact:** Low risk.
* **Remediation Steps:**
    * Utilise prepared statements that incorporate parameter binding. For instance, instead of `INSERT INTO public.cert_config (id, description, ...) VALUES (nextval('cert_config_id_seq'), 'Test config', ...);`, use parameterised queries like `INSERT INTO public.cert_config (id, description, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...);` ensuring parameters are bound securely. [cite: 5, 6]
    * If using Liquibase, adhere to their specified patterns for parameter substitution. [cite: 7]
    * Think about using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, as they automatically manage parameterisation. [cite: 7]

---

**3. Insufficient Data Validation**

* **Description:** Tables do not have adequate constraints for validating data. [cite: 8] This issue was identified in `202206221737-cert-config-ddl.sql` and `202308241405-response-audit-ddl.sql`. [cite: 8]
* **Impact:** Low risk.
* **Remediation Steps:**
    * Incorporate suitable CHECK constraints to ensure data validation. [cite: 9]
    * Define length limits for VARCHAR columns. [cite: 9]
    * Add NOT NULL constraints where fields are mandatory. [cite: 9]
    * Implement table and column constraints. For example, change an unconstrained column like in `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR, filer_carrier_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, ...);` to include proper constraints: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(255), filer_carrier_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (filer_carrier_id ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9]+$'), ...);`. [cite: 8, 9]
    * Consider employing domain types for data formats that are specialised. [cite: 10]

---

**4. Exposed Internal Infrastructure Details**

* **Description:** Details of internal infrastructure, such as queue names and directory structures, are exposed within the scripts. [cite: 10] This affects `202206221918-mq-config-carriers-dml.sql`, `202207011045-update-data-feed-filename-pattern.sql`, and `202305191505-data-feed-fix.sql`. [cite: 11]
* **Impact:** Low risk.
* **Remediation Steps:**
    * Store details of the infrastructure in an external configuration. [cite: 12]
    * Use reference keys in place of actual infrastructure paths. [cite: 12]
    * Implement a pattern for configuration lookup. For instance, instead of hard-coding queue names like `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., inbound_mq_queue, outbound_mq_queue, ...) VALUES (..., 'PREDICT.IN.CARA', 'PREDICT.OUT.CARA', ...);`, use configuration references such as `INSERT INTO public.mq_config (..., inbound_mq_queue, outbound_mq_queue, ...) VALUES (..., get_config('QUEUE_CARA_IN'), get_config('QUEUE_CARA_OUT'), ...);`. [cite: 11, 12]
    * Think about encrypting sensitive details related to infrastructure. [cite: 13]

---

**5. Limited Column Constraints**

* **Description:** Many columns within the created tables do not have restrictions on length or other constraints; specifically, VARCHAR columns lack length limits. [cite: 13, 14] This was noted in `202206221737-cert-config-ddl.sql` (lines 6-12) and `202308241405-response-audit-ddl.sql` (lines 9-18). [cite: 14]
* **Impact:** Low risk.
* **Remediation Steps:**
    * Apply appropriate length constraints to all VARCHAR columns. [cite: 15]
    * Implement data type constraints. For example, instead of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR, filer_carrier_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, ...);`, add length constraints: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cert_config (id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(255), filer_carrier_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, ...);`. [cite: 14, 15]
    * Consider using data types that are specialised for particular formats (e.g., UUID). [cite: 16]
 


Okay, here is an expanded explanation of the potential impact for each of the identified vulnerabilities. While the report currently categorises these as "Low risk", understanding the potential consequences is crucial for a comprehensive security posture.

### Expanded Impact of Penetration Test Findings

---

**1. Environment Variable Injection Risk**

* **Vulnerability:** Environment variable placeholders might be vulnerable to injection (e.g., `"${ENV}"` in SQL files).
* **Expanded Impact:** Although deemed low risk in this instance, if an attacker can control or influence the values of environment variables, they could potentially inject malicious data or commands into the application. This could lead to:
    * **Unauthorised Data Access or Modification:** Injected SQL code, if the environment variable is used in database queries, could lead to data breaches or unauthorised changes to the database.
    * **Information Disclosure:** The injection might cause the application to reveal sensitive configuration details or error messages that could aid further attacks.
    * **Denial of Service:** Malformed input could potentially crash the application or the services that rely on these variables.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, if the injected variable is used in a context with higher privileges, it might allow an attacker to gain elevated access.
    * **Poor Secret Management:** Relying on environment variables for secrets can lead to them being poorly managed, not rotated regularly, hard to audit, and often stored in plain text, increasing the risk of exposure through logs or accidental commitment to repositories.

---

**2. Lack of Statement Parameterisation**

* **Vulnerability:** SQL statements directly insert values rather than using parameterisation.
* **Expanded Impact:** This is a classic precursor to SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Even if currently assessed as low risk (perhaps due to other mitigating controls or limited exposure), the potential impacts are significant:
    * **SQL Injection:** This is the primary concern. Attackers could insert malicious SQL code into input fields. If these inputs are directly concatenated into SQL queries, the attacker could:
        * Bypass authentication mechanisms.
        * Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information, financial records).
        * Modify or delete data in the database, leading to data loss or corruption.
        * Execute administrative operations on the database, potentially taking full control or causing a denial of service.
    * **Data Integrity Issues:** Even without malicious intent, direct value insertion can sometimes lead to errors if data types are not handled correctly, potentially corrupting data.
    * **Reduced Performance:** Databases often cache execution plans for parameterised queries. Non-parameterised queries can lead to new query plans being generated for each execution, potentially impacting database performance.

---

**3. Insufficient Data Validation**

* **Vulnerability:** Tables lack adequate constraints for validating data (e.g., missing CHECK constraints, length limits, or NOT NULL constraints).
* **Expanded Impact:** Insufficient data validation can lead to a range of issues, primarily affecting data integrity and application stability:
    * **Data Corruption/Inconsistency:** Without proper validation, incorrect, malformed, or unexpected data can be inserted into the database. This can lead to inconsistencies, making data unreliable for business processes, reporting, or decision-making.
    * **Application Errors and Crashes:** Applications relying on the data might behave unexpectedly or crash if they encounter data in a format or state they weren't designed to handle.
    * **Security Vulnerabilities:** In some cases, if unvalidated data is processed or displayed by other parts of the system, it could lead to injection attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting if data is reflected on a web page) or buffer overflows if length limits aren't enforced and the data is used in fixed-size buffers.
    * **Business Logic Flaws:** Incorrect data can lead to flawed execution of business rules, potentially causing financial miscalculations, incorrect order processing, or other operational problems.
    * **Increased Development and Maintenance Costs:** Dealing with the consequences of bad data can be time-consuming and costly, requiring significant effort to clean up data and fix resulting application issues.

---

**4. Exposed Internal Infrastructure Details**

* **Vulnerability:** Queue names and directory structures are exposed in scripts.
* **Expanded Impact:** Revealing internal infrastructure details, while sometimes considered a low direct risk, provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance information:
    * **Attack Surface Mapping:** Knowledge of internal queue names, server names, directory paths, or IP addresses helps an attacker understand the internal architecture of the system. This information can be used to identify potential targets and tailor further attacks more effectively.
    * **Facilitating Lateral Movement:** If an attacker gains an initial foothold in the network, this information can help them navigate internal systems and identify sensitive services or data stores more easily.
    * **Targeted Exploitation:** Knowing specific technologies or naming conventions can allow attackers to search for known vulnerabilities in those components or attempt to exploit common misconfigurations.
    * **Reduced Obscurity:** While security through obscurity is not a robust defence on its own, unnecessarily exposing internal details removes a layer of difficulty for potential attackers.
    * **Insider Threat Amplification:** Malicious insiders can leverage this information more easily to cause harm or exfiltrate data.

---

**5. Limited Column Constraints**

* **Vulnerability:** Many VARCHAR columns lack specific length limits or other constraints.
* **Expanded Impact:** Similar to insufficient data validation, the lack of specific column constraints (especially length limits for string data) can have several negative consequences:
    * **Data Truncation or Errors:** If an application attempts to insert data longer than what the underlying system can eventually handle (even if the database column itself is overly permissive), it could lead to silent data truncation or application errors.
    * **Inefficient Storage and Performance:** Allowing arbitrarily long strings when only short ones are expected can lead to inefficient use of database storage. It can also impact query performance, as processing very large string fields can be slower.
    * **Buffer Overflow Potential (in consuming applications):** If applications reading this data allocate fixed-size buffers based on an assumed maximum length (which isn't enforced by the database), unexpectedly long data could lead to buffer overflows in those applications, potentially causing crashes or creating security vulnerabilities.
    * **Data Quality Issues:** Lack of constraints makes it easier for erroneous or oversized data to enter the system, reducing overall data quality and reliability.
    * **Difficult Data Integration:** When integrating with other systems that may have stricter length requirements, these unconstrained columns can cause compatibility issues.

By addressing these "Low risk" items, you not only fix the immediate minor issue but also contribute to a more robust and resilient security posture, preventing these from potentially combining with other issues to create a more significant vulnerability.
