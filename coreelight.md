Okay, I've reviewed the Corelight settings in the PDF. Here's an assessment of potential vulnerabilities:

## Security Assessment of Corelight Configuration

Based on the provided screenshots, here are potential vulnerabilities, their descriptions, impacts, and recommended remediation steps.

---

### 1. Brute Force Prevention Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE BRUTE FORCE PREVENTION" toggle is shown in an off state in one of the images. [cite: 1] If this setting is indeed disabled, it means there's no mechanism to block or slow down repeated login attempts with different passwords.
* **Impact**: Attackers can use automated tools to try a vast number of password combinations in a short period, significantly increasing the chances of guessing a valid password and gaining unauthorized access.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to the "LOGIN BEHAVIORS" section. [cite: 1]
    2.  Toggle "ENABLE BRUTE FORCE PREVENTION" to the on position.
    3.  Click "Save". [cite: 1]
    4.  It's also advisable to configure appropriate thresholds for lockout (e.g., number of failed attempts, lockout duration) if such options are available.

---

### 2. Auto Logout for Idle Sessions Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE AUTO LOGOUT FOR IDLE USER SESSIONS" toggle is shown in an off state. [cite: 1] This means that user sessions will remain active indefinitely, even if the user is no longer actively using the system.
* **Impact**: If a user leaves their workstation unattended while logged into Corelight, an unauthorized person could gain access to the system through the active session. This could lead to data breaches, configuration changes, or other malicious activities.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to the "LOGIN BEHAVIORS" section. [cite: 1]
    2.  Toggle "ENABLE AUTO LOGOUT FOR IDLE USER SESSIONS" to the on position. [cite: 1]
    3.  Click "Save". [cite: 1]
    4.  Configure an appropriate idle timeout period (e.g., 15-30 minutes) based on your organization's security policy.

---

### 3. Prompt for Default Password Change Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "PROMPT USERS TO CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORD" toggle is shown in an off state. [cite: 1] If new users are created with default or easily guessable passwords, and they are not forced to change them upon their first login, these accounts remain highly vulnerable.
* **Impact**: Accounts using default or weak passwords are prime targets for attackers. Compromise of such an account can grant an attacker initial access to the system, which can then be escalated.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to the "LOGIN BEHAVIORS" section. [cite: 1]
    2.  Toggle "PROMPT USERS TO CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORD" to the on position. [cite: 1]
    3.  Click "Save". [cite: 1]
    4.  Ensure all current users, especially those with administrative privileges, are not using default passwords.

---

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Not Enforced for Admin SSH Access

* **Description**: In the "USER PROFILE" for the 'admin' user, there's a note stating "2FA not enforced for this user on SSH access". [cite: 3] While the admin user has 2FA enabled for the web interface (indicated by "Yos" under the 2FA column for the 'admin' user [cite: 3]), SSH access for this privileged account is not protected by 2FA.
* **Impact**: SSH is a powerful remote access method. If the admin account's SSH access is compromised (e.g., through password guessing or a stolen private key), an attacker could gain full administrative control over the Corelight sensor without needing a second authentication factor.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  It's critical to enforce 2FA for all administrative access methods, including SSH.
    2.  Investigate Corelight's documentation or SSH configuration options to enable 2FA for SSH sessions. This might involve configuring Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) or other SSH-specific 2FA mechanisms.
    3.  If direct 2FA on SSH is not supported, consider alternative controls like bastion hosts with 2FA or restricting SSH access to highly controlled IP addresses and using strong key-based authentication.

---

### 5. Global Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE GLOBAL TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)" toggle is shown in an off state in the "SECURE ACCESS" settings. [cite: 4] This implies that 2FA is not enforced globally for all users by default.
* **Impact**: If 2FA is not globally enforced, individual users (including new ones) might not have it enabled, making their accounts more susceptible to compromise through stolen credentials. Even if some users (like 'admin') have 2FA enabled individually[cite: 3], not enforcing it globally means other accounts could be vulnerable.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to "Admin" > "Secure Access". [cite: 4]
    2.  Toggle "ENABLE GLOBAL TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)" to the on position. [cite: 4]
    3.  Click "Save".
    4.  Ensure all users are enrolled in 2FA.

---

### 6. Password Policy Potentially Not Enforced

* **Description**: The "ENFORCE PASSWORD POLICY" toggle is shown in an off state. [cite: 4] This means there are likely no system-enforced rules for password complexity (length, character types), history, or other good password practices.
* **Impact**: Without an enforced password policy, users may choose weak, easily guessable passwords (e.g., "password123", "admin"). This significantly increases the risk of successful brute-force or dictionary attacks.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to "Admin" > "Secure Access". [cite: 4]
    2.  Toggle "ENFORCE PASSWORD POLICY" to the on position. [cite: 4]
    3.  Configure a strong password policy that mandates minimum length, use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Define password history and lockout policies if available.
    4.  Click "Save".

---

### 7. Password Expiration Policy Potentially Not Enforced

* **Description**: The "ENFORCE PASSWORD EXPIRATION POLICY" toggle is shown in an off state. [cite: 4] This indicates that user passwords will not expire, and users will not be required to change them periodically.
* **Impact**: If a password is compromised and remains unchanged, an attacker can maintain persistent access. Regular password changes limit the window of opportunity for an attacker who has obtained credentials.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to "Admin" > "Secure Access". [cite: 4]
    2.  Toggle "ENFORCE PASSWORD EXPIRATION POLICY" to the on position. [cite: 4]
    3.  Configure a reasonable password expiration period (e.g., 90 days) in line with your organization's security policy.
    4.  Click "Save".

---

### 8. TLS 1.1 Potentially Allowed

* **Description**: The "ALLOW TLS V1.1" toggle is shown in an on state (or at least, it's not explicitly disabled, and the default might be to allow it). [cite: 4] TLS 1.1 is an outdated version of the Transport Layer Security protocol with known vulnerabilities.
* **Impact**: Allowing TLS 1.1 can expose web communications with the Corelight appliance to man-in-the-middle attacks and decryption of sensitive data. Modern browsers and security best practices recommend using TLS 1.2 or higher.
* **Remediation Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to "Admin" > "Secure Access". [cite: 4]
    2.  If the toggle "ALLOW TLS V1.1" means it *enables* TLS 1.1, then toggle it to the **off** position to disable it. If the toggle means "ALLOW *ONLY* TLS v1.1" (which is less likely), then ensure it's off and that TLS 1.2 or 1.3 is enabled. The goal is to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
    3.  Ensure that TLS 1.2 and preferably TLS 1.3 are enabled and prioritized.
    4.  Click "Save".

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context is Key**: The actual risk posed by these settings depends on the overall security posture of your network, how Corelight is deployed, and what other compensating controls are in place.
* **Default Settings**: Many of these appear to be default settings that have not been hardened. It's crucial to review all security-related configurations after deploying any new system.
* **Documentation**: Always refer to the official Corelight documentation for the most accurate information on configuring these settings and understanding their implications.

By addressing these potential vulnerabilities, you can significantly improve the security of your Corelight deployment.






Okay, here's an assessment of each potential vulnerability with an estimated risk rating and a possible CVSS v3.1 score.

**Important Note on CVSS Scores:** The CVSS scores provided are *estimates*. A precise CVSS score requires a full understanding of the specific Corelight version, the surrounding network environment, existing compensating controls, and the potential impact on the organization. These estimates are based on the general implications of the observed settings.

### 1. Brute Force Prevention Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE BRUTE FORCE PREVENTION" toggle is shown in an off state[cite: 1]. If this setting is disabled, there's no mechanism to block or slow down repeated login attempts.
* **Risk Rating**: **High**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 8.1 (High)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network) - Assumes login is network accessible.
        * `AC:H` (Attack Complexity: High) - While brute-force tools are common, success depends on password complexity which is unknown; if passwords are weak, AC could be Low. Assuming some level of password strength as a baseline.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None) - Attacker needs no prior privileges.
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None) - No user interaction needed.
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged) - The attack impacts the Corelight system itself.
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - Successful login could expose sensitive data.
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High) - Successful login could allow system modification.
        * `A:H` (Availability: High) - Successful login could lead to denial of service (e.g., by changing configs or shutting down).

### 2. Auto Logout for Idle Sessions Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE AUTO LOGOUT FOR IDLE USER SESSIONS" toggle is shown in an off state[cite: 1]. User sessions may remain active indefinitely if idle.
* **Risk Rating**: **Medium**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 6.8 (Medium)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:P` (Attack Vector: Physical) - Requires physical access to an unattended, logged-in workstation.
        * `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - If a session is found open, it's trivial to use.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None) - Attacker uses the already authenticated session.
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None) - Relies on the legitimate user leaving the session unattended.
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - Full access to the compromised user's data/privileges.
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High) - Full ability to modify data/settings as the compromised user.
        * `A:H` (Availability: High) - Potential to disrupt system as the compromised user.

### 3. Prompt for Default Password Change Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "PROMPT USERS TO CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORD" toggle is shown in an off state[cite: 1, 2]. New users might not be forced to change default passwords.
* **Risk Rating**: **High**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 7.5 (High) to 9.8 (Critical) if default passwords are known/trivial. Assuming they are not publicly known but potentially weak:
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` (This is a general score for weak credentials; if default credentials are *known*, it's closer to Critical)
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - If default passwords are easy to guess or standard.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High)
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High)
        * `A:H` (Availability: High)

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Not Enforced for Admin SSH Access

* **Description**: For the 'admin' user, "2FA not enforced for this user on SSH access" is noted[cite: 3]. SSH for the admin account lacks 2FA.
* **Risk Rating**: **Critical**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 8.8 (High) to 9.8 (Critical)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` (PR:L if admin password/key is obtained; PR:N if weak password guessed)
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - Standard credential attack.
        * `PR:L` (Privileges Required: Low) - Assumes attacker has obtained SSH credentials (e.g., password, key) for the admin account through other means. If the vulnerability implies weak SSH passwords guessable without prior info, PR could be N.
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - Admin access.
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High) - Admin access.
        * `A:H` (Availability: High) - Admin access.
    * *Note: If this leads to root OS access, Scope could change to Changed (S:C), further increasing the score.*

### 5. Global Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Potentially Disabled

* **Description**: The "ENABLE GLOBAL TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)" toggle is off in "SECURE ACCESS"[cite: 4]. 2FA isn't globally enforced.
* **Risk Rating**: **High**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 8.1 (High)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` (UI:R if phishing is the method for credential theft, UI:N for password spraying)
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - For attacks like password spraying or credential stuffing.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None) - Attacker targets accounts directly.
        * `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required) - If considering phishing for credentials. If considering password spraying against accounts without 2FA, UI:N. Let's use UI:R for a more conservative initial estimate, but it can be UI:N.
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - Access to any user account without 2FA.
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High)
        * `A:H` (Availability: High)

### 6. Password Policy Potentially Not Enforced

* **Description**: The "ENFORCE PASSWORD POLICY" toggle is off[cite: 4]. No system-enforced rules for password strength.
* **Risk Rating**: **High**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 7.5 (High)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low) - Easy to guess or crack weak passwords.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High)
        * `I:H` (Integrity: High)
        * `A:H` (Availability: High)

---

### 7. Password Expiration Policy Potentially Not Enforced

* **Description**: The "ENFORCE PASSWORD EXPIRATION POLICY" toggle is off[cite: 4]. Passwords do not expire.
* **Risk Rating**: **Medium**
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 5.9 (Medium)
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L`
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:H` (Attack Complexity: High) - This vulnerability doesn't directly lead to compromise but extends the window if credentials are stolen via other means.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - If a compromised password is used.
        * `I:L` (Integrity: Low) - Less direct impact on integrity from non-expiring password itself.
        * `A:L` (Availability: Low) - Less direct impact on availability.
    * *Note: The main impact is increasing the risk from other vulnerabilities (e.g., if a password is stolen and never expires).*

### 8. TLS 1.1 Potentially Allowed

* **Description**: The "ALLOW TLS V1.1" toggle is shown in an on state or not explicitly disabled[cite: 4].
* **Risk Rating**: **Medium** (can be High depending on data sensitivity and network exposure)
* **Possible CVSS v3.1 Score**: 5.9 (Medium) to 7.4 (High) for known TLS 1.1 exploits if exploitable in context.
    * **Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N`
    * **Rationale**:
        * `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
        * `AC:H` (Attack Complexity: High) - Requires a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position and exploiting known TLS 1.1 weaknesses.
        * `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
        * `UI:N` (User Interaction: None) - For the protocol weakness itself.
        * `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
        * `C:H` (Confidentiality: High) - If sensitive data (e.g., session cookies, credentials) can be decrypted.
        * `I:L` (Integrity: Low) - Some TLS attacks can allow limited injection, but primarily confidentiality.
        * `A:N` (Availability: None)

---

These ratings and scores should help prioritize remediation efforts. Focus on Critical and High-risk items first.
